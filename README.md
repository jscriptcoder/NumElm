# NumElm
Inspired by NumPy, a [Python package](http://www.numpy.org/), NumElm is the fundamental package for
scientific computing with Elm.

## Motivation
As a huge fan of Functional Programming I'm extremely interested in Elm language. I'm also passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Ever since I started studying these subjects I've been trying to figure out how to mix these worlds, Frontend/Functional Programming/Elm and Machine/Deep Learning, together. **NumElm** is the first step in these _quest_ of mine.
