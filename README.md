# NumElm
Inspired by NumPy, a Python [package](http://www.numpy.org/), NumElm is the fundamental package for
scientific computing with Elm. The core data structure is the **NdArray**, a multidimensional container of items of the same type and size. The number of dimensions and items in an NdArray is defined by its _Shape_, which is a list of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. The type of items in the array is specified by a separate data-type object, _Dtype_, one of which is associated with each NdArray.

## Motivation
As a huge fan of Functional Programming, I'm extremely interested in Elm language. I'm also passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Ever since I started studying these subjects I've been trying to figure out how to mix these worlds, Frontend/Functional Programming/Elm and Machine/Deep Learning, together. **NumElm** is the first step in these _quest_ of mine.
